# Du Bois Challenge 2025

The goal of this challenge is to celebrate the data viz legacy of W.E.B Du Boisâ€”a Black American civil rights activist, sociologist and writerâ€”by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools.

This challenge was organized by the Data Visualization Society.
There are 10 different visualizations.
